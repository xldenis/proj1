# How to use this date set

An XML list of all files can be found at: http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/

This dateset contains a collection of the top 100 from 10 default subreddits.

It contains the top 100 posts of the year as of 15/8/2014.
Each post is saved as a JSON file, which is the format reddit supplies.
The data is seperated into folders based on the subreddit. 

Each JSON file represents a single post and has 2 main parts, the 'meta' section and the 'comments' section.

The 'meta' section contains meta data about the post such as the date of creation,
the score of the post, the number of comments in the post, as well as the actual link for the post.

The general format of the JSON file is as follows

{
    "meta": {
        "approved_by": null,
        "author": "pimple_poppins",
        "author_flair_css_class": null,

        "secure_media": null,
        "secure_media_embed": {},
        "selftext": "",
        "selftext_html": null,
        "stickied": false,
        "subreddit": "sports",
        "subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzy",
        "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ethsg15qsnxq2ecm.jpg",
        "title": "Retired NFL star Brian Holloway's home was broken into by 300 kids who partied and vandalized the home.",
        "ups": 3105,
        "url": "http://www.helpmesave300.com/",
        "user_reports": [],
        "visited": false
    },
    "comments": [ list of commments ... ]
}

Classes and labels, such as subreddit, can be extracted from the meta data.

The 'comment' section contains a list of the top level comments from the post.

Each comment has the following structure, the replies section is recursive and contains a list of comments.

Of particular interest are the 'body' field and the score 'field'. The strcuture is as follows.

{
    "approved_by": null,
    "author": "ThisIsMyCouchAccount",
    "author_flair_css_class": null,
    "author_flair_text": null,

}

The raw compressed JSON for each subreddit can be downloaded from our AWS bucket using the following links.

http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/aww.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/books.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/funny.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/iama.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/movies.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/news.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/pics.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/science.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/sports.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/compressed/videos.tgz

Additional to the raw JSON data is our set of extracted features.

For each subreddit we created a cvs file which contains a tabulartion of the
word frequency for each of the comments in that subreddit.

For our features we selected the top 2500 most common words from all of our data.
For each comment we created a vector, which corresponds to a single row in the csv file,
to represent the frequency of theses word in the comment.
This allowed us to easily segment the testing and training data.

For example:

__________| game| baseball| fan| sport| dog| hello| ... 2494 more words ....
comment 1 |    1|        1|   0|     0|   0|     0|
comment 2 |    0|        0|   1|     0|   0|     0|
comment 3 |    0|        0|   0|     0|   1|     0|

These csv files are quite sparse and are mostly filled with zeros so they are fairly small when compressed.

They can be downloaded from the following places:

http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/features/books-features.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/features/funny-features.tgz
http://comp598.s3.amazonaws.com/features/iama-features.tgz (This file does not exist since we did not use this subreddit in our report as it was too large.)
