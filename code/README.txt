For the Matlab files to implement the basic naive Bayes classifier algorithm: 
The CSV files containing the features need to be manually loaded at the beginning of runNaiveBayes.m wrapper.
The amount of data, i.e. the number of comments, to be used and the number of classes to classify can also be manually adjusted at the beginning of the wrapper.
naiveBayes.m is a Matlab function the returns the class prediction, log posterior, and percent error of the test data.
To replicate the results figures in the report, matlabPlots.m can be used.
